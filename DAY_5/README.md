# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📚 Internship Task 5: Data Analyst Role

This project involves performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).  
The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, and summarize key observations.

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `Titanic_EDA_Task5.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing the full code and analysis
- `Titanic_EDA_Task5.pdf` — PDF report generated from the Notebook
- `train.csv` — Titanic training dataset (used for analysis)
- `README.md` — Project description file (this file)

---

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (inside VS Code)

---

## 📊 Main Tasks Performed
- Data Loading and Overview
- Handling Missing Values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)
- Univariate Analysis (Survival, Gender, Class, Age, Fare)
- Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis (Survival vs Gender, Class, Embarked)
- Correlation Heatmap and Pairplots
- Final Observations and Summary of Findings

---

## 📋 Key Insights
- Women had a higher survival rate than men.
- First-class passengers survived more than others.
- Children (0-10 years) had better survival chances.
- Fare price positively impacted survival probability.
- Passengers from Cherbourg port ('C') had slightly better survival rates.

---

## 🧠 Learnings
- How to handle missing data properly.
- Visualizing patterns and trends through graphs.
- Finding correlation among features.
- Summarizing EDA findings in a professional format.
