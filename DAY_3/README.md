# 🛠️ SQL for Data Analysis – E-Commerce Dataset

## 📋 Project Overview
As part of my Data Analyst Internship at **Inelevant Labs**, I completed Task 3:  
**Using SQL to extract, analyze, and understand business data** from an e-commerce dataset.

---

## 📦 Dataset Details
- **Filename:** Online-eCommerce.csv
- **Imported into MySQL as:** `online_ecommerce` table
- Contains fields like `Order_Number`, `Customer_Name`, `Order_Date`, `Product`, `Sales`, `Quantity`, etc.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Practice SQL query writing for real-world datasets
- Extract key business insights (sales, revenue, top products, etc.)
- Use aggregation, grouping, and subqueries
- Visualize results via query outputs

---

## 🔍 SQL Concepts Used
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `ROUND()`
- Subqueries
- `CREATE VIEW`
- String manipulation using `SUBSTR()` for date parsing

## 📊 Key Queries Written
| Query | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| Q1 | Total number of unique orders |
| Q2 | Total revenue generated |
| Q3 | Top 5 states by revenue |
| Q4 | Monthly revenue trend |
| Q5 | Average order sales |
| Q6 | Top 10 best-selling products |
| Q7 | High-value customers (spent > ₹50,000) |
| Q8 | Create a View : Customer Performance Summary |

📂 Queries stored in: [`task3_queries.sql`](./task3_queries.sql)
