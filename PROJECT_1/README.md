# 📦 E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis

This project was completed as part of my **Data Analyst Internship** and focuses on analyzing and reducing product return rates in an e-commerce setting. The dashboard was built using Power BI and leverages the **Online Retail dataset** to uncover key return trends, high-risk products, and customer behaviors that influence returns.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To identify why customers return products and how return rates vary by product, geography, and purchase behavior. The goal is to derive actionable insights to reduce future return rates and improve overall profitability.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and data visualization  
- **DAX** – Calculated columns and measures for KPIs  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and transformation  
- **Excel** – Source dataset (`Online Retail.xlsx`)

## 📌 Key Measures

- `Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price`  
- `Total Sales = SUM(Revenue)` (non-return invoices)  
- `Total Returns = SUM(Revenue)` (only return invoices)  
- `Return Rate (%) = Total Returns / Total Sales`

---

## 🧠 Insights

- A few products contributed to **over 60% of returns**  
- **Returns spike in December**, indicating seasonal issues  
- **UK customers** had the highest return volume  
- Suggest reviewing product descriptions, delivery issues, and top-return SKUs
